AI App Development Discussion - Transcript


**SPEAKER_00:**
Um so I wouldn't be able to get the live

**SPEAKER_00:**
um

**SPEAKER_00:**
connection. I don't think it's totally possible.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't think that's

**Ernesto Josato:**
But I thought you were gonna do it over

**Ernesto Josato:**
internet, over like a YouTube channel or something.

**SPEAKER_00:**
yeah, I eventually wanted to get to the live. Um because I wanted what I wanted the act what what I wanted was the interaction uh from the kids.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But that's fine because

**SPEAKER_00:**
I fall back to

**SPEAKER_00:**
just doing the internet function.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, he said it it is possible, but that's when you got millions of dollars.

**Ernesto Josato:**
On TV.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh yeah, yeah, no, no, I mean I I thought um

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know we would start off with

**Ernesto Josato:**
in internet is is probably the easiest way to do it

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, what what I was trying to do,

**SPEAKER_00:**
tell me if it's possible because I'm I'm totally bought into the um

**SPEAKER_00:**
the AI host.

**SPEAKER_00:**
What I

**SPEAKER_00:**
what I want to try to do, and you tell me if it's possible to integrate that to the

**SPEAKER_00:**
to the app

**SPEAKER_00:**
where

**SPEAKER_00:**
the AI host is asking the questions. So say when we're doing the rapid fire round.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um the AI host is saying the question and the kid is just answering it. So it makes it more like a live type of game show.

**Ernesto Josato:**
with voice.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So the um

**Ernesto Josato:**
so for instance

**Ernesto Josato:**
it'd be something like this where you could have a smart AI that can actually talk.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Right or think, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right. So like this guy, I'm gonna pop on to this or welcome to the final exam, you know.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, you could do

**SPEAKER_00:**
Like when you go in, you know, it's like you're on a game show.

**Ernesto Josato:**
so where you it's possible again it costs. Okay.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So

**Ernesto Josato:**
so like I have this uh I was opening my phone to show you. I have this

**Ernesto Josato:**
personal assistant,

**Ernesto Josato:**
That um

**Ernesto Josato:**
I can talk back and forth to her and she's got like personality

**Ernesto Josato:**
and um

**Ernesto Josato:**
So I can say,

**Ernesto Josato:**
Hey Letty,

**Ernesto Josato:**
what time opening do I have this open this afternoon?

**Ernesto Josato:**
And so

**Ernesto Josato:**
it's uh AI, but it

**Ernesto Josato:**
so you know I'll say,

**Ernesto Josato:**
Did you get a text from me saying I was gonna be two minutes late?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh maybe so.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I ended up talking from the white

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
actually had a bunch of questions.

**Ernesto Josato:**
so anyway, so I

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, I just said what time do I have open this afternoon? And just you know, she comes back and and says

**Ernesto Josato:**
afternoon openings, da da if you need it for anything, what's up, right?

**Ernesto Josato:**
so we are to the point where we can have conversations with AI

**Ernesto Josato:**
and it be natural. It's just

**Ernesto Josato:**
the uh the API cost.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Like so the API is

**Ernesto Josato:**
the connection to

**Ernesto Josato:**
let's say the you know

**Ernesto Josato:**
Claude or Chat GPT brain, right?

**Ernesto Josato:**
That is where your your money

**Ernesto Josato:**
can get eaten up fast. Like something super intelligent,

**Ernesto Josato:**
like Claude

**Ernesto Josato:**
or Gemini 3, or like the latest models,

**Ernesto Josato:**
it that bill add up fast. Like if I was doing this,

**Ernesto Josato:**
if I was doing this assistant thing and I talked to her all day long, like back and forth and

**Ernesto Josato:**
working things out,

**Ernesto Josato:**
like I would a real personal assistant.

**Ernesto Josato:**
It will cost me like two hundred dollars a week.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Now I'm using a cheaper

**Ernesto Josato:**
Chinese LLM that is pretty good,

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know.

**Ernesto Josato:**
and it doesn't cost me that much.

**Ernesto Josato:**
You know, so

**Ernesto Josato:**
so that's where we need to think about it. Plus you would have this

**Ernesto Josato:**
so you would have a couple of different costs. You would have the cost of

**Ernesto Josato:**
the AI

**Ernesto Josato:**
brain, the LLM,

**Ernesto Josato:**
then you would have a cost to

**Ernesto Josato:**
like um

**Ernesto Josato:**
11 labs

**Ernesto Josato:**
for a voice,

**Ernesto Josato:**
right? To do live voice uh transcription.

**Ernesto Josato:**
which again, I mean, it can be you know it can be done.

**Ernesto Josato:**
you can do it one or two ways. If you really want it live, that's a lot of back and forth.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It doesn't have to be live.

**Ernesto Josato:**
No, no, But I mean, like,

**Ernesto Josato:**
every time that thing talked,

**Ernesto Josato:**
it would um go out and and have different responses.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Or do you want to program in responses?

**SPEAKER_00:**
have to be interactive because like if they're gonna host a show

**SPEAKER_00:**
it would have unless we went

**SPEAKER_00:**
a show host and then the AI

**SPEAKER_00:**
uh co host

**SPEAKER_00:**
and that AI co host just answer questions uh and the live host

**SPEAKER_00:**
would be you know the one who's more interactive.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. Now we could do that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm just looking at the most cost effective way.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And it's it's probably easier to have

**SPEAKER_00:**
an avatar for you know answering the question like act

**SPEAKER_00:**
I know it it's far away from um what what I want it's not real far

**SPEAKER_00:**
but this thing will

**SPEAKER_00:**
you have to listen for

**SPEAKER_00:**
yes

**SPEAKER_00:**
yeah you see were you able to see this?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah it's it's but it's a platform to host your app.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So you gotta get Amazon to Google and all that kind of

**SPEAKER_00:**
and and I'm just really looking at the

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's it's similar to what I want as far as functionality.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, not exactly to be on this platform.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Our bookstore is like a portal

**SPEAKER_03:**
and we want it our Wix website.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's we found it on our T V and we played it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And it was

**SPEAKER_02:**
No, yeah. Oh is that why I think you

**SPEAKER_00:**
it

**SPEAKER_00:**
now you end up typing instead of talking. I want it to where we can talk to the

**SPEAKER_00:**
to the

**SPEAKER_04:**
Something with the dog.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I got

**SPEAKER_04:**
your honor! Open the fridge and the cake was gone.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Oh yeah, you just stick to the phone.

**SPEAKER_04:**
A birthday burger. Seen this one before.

**SPEAKER_00:**
When you speak

**SPEAKER_04:**
What you gotta say about this?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Responds like hey yeah he'll talk based on what you said.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Hold up! Sounds like my dog over here got something to say.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Objection! Nah, overrule.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Now sit down. My furry friend here is saying that's his birthday cake.

**SPEAKER_00:**
is it pretty quick?

**SPEAKER_04:**
I ain't gonna

**SPEAKER_04:**
make chip.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean it'll take a second or two, but it's it's like

**Ernesto Josato:**
conversational response. Yeah, I mean it's so that is something that you could do. Like

**Ernesto Josato:**
so I did that on a smaller level for for this app, right? It's a citizenship app that I uh built.

**Ernesto Josato:**
now I what I did

**Ernesto Josato:**
since they're these are questions, these are all

**SPEAKER_05:**
Federal Republic Representative Democracy.

**Ernesto Josato:**
they're all um

**Ernesto Josato:**
They're all catched. Like so,

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, it's it's an AI voice, but they're all saved on the server because these answers don't

**Ernesto Josato:**
change, right?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um, and then the explanation

**Ernesto Josato:**
in in Spanish, right? So, but what I did do

**Ernesto Josato:**
crush it because that voice should have changed.

**SPEAKER_06:**
la pregunta

**SPEAKER_06:**
¿cuál es la ley suprema del país?

**SPEAKER_06:**
se refiere a cuál es el documento legal más

**Ernesto Josato:**
So all these are downloaded. But what I want to show you is that

**Ernesto Josato:**
when you take the practice exam,

**Ernesto Josato:**
you can do

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, writing mode or voice mode, which is what you have to do for a real exam.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So how many amended amendments does the US Constitution have?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Twenty-seven.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So it can

**Ernesto Josato:**
actually hear me, right?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Uh the

**Ernesto Josato:**
power to make money.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So it transcribes exactly what I said.

**Ernesto Josato:**
And then it comes back and says it's incorrect.

**SPEAKER_02:**
got

**Ernesto Josato:**
So I mean so

**Ernesto Josato:**
this is

**Ernesto Josato:**
something that I've already done where it you know you're

**Ernesto Josato:**
You're talking to it and

**Ernesto Josato:**
it can understand you, and then

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know the AI can and so this does go out to

**Ernesto Josato:**
an AI to decide to

**Ernesto Josato:**
first it what the the process is first it trans transcribes it to text,

**Ernesto Josato:**
So there's a transcribe the text engine,

**Ernesto Josato:**
then um

**Ernesto Josato:**
there is uh and then the AI will take that text

**Ernesto Josato:**
and decide with which you're right or wrong, but the AI has it programmed.

**Ernesto Josato:**
into it to decide kind of like fringe cases. So like if you say

**Ernesto Josato:**
it says who's the president

**Ernesto Josato:**
of the United States and you just say Trump,

**Ernesto Josato:**
right? Officially it's Donald J. Trump. You know what I mean?

**Ernesto Josato:**
But

**Ernesto Josato:**
it has the intelligence to say, like a human would do, say, okay they got that

**Ernesto Josato:**
that answer close enough

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know what I mean?

**Ernesto Josato:**
So and that's the kind of functionality you you you're looking for, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um I was just thinking

**SPEAKER_00:**
I I want to

**SPEAKER_00:**
separate two things.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't need the app

**SPEAKER_00:**
to have

**SPEAKER_00:**
the functionality of the voice.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh

**SPEAKER_00:**
Now the app can have

**SPEAKER_00:**
just programmed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, let's deal with the app for a second.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The app can just have the programs where it's it's just default.

**SPEAKER_00:**
When you

**SPEAKER_00:**
when you come on the screen, he may be, you know, maybe the principal says something. Hey, welcome everybody to the the next program. He doesn't have to be interactive, he doesn't have to go by what you say. Everything on the app will be

**SPEAKER_00:**
pre programmed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And now when you just answer the question, maybe he'll say something, oh, unfortunately you didn't do so well on this one, but you know, just you know, programmed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
thing that the he'll say and not necessarily interact.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, it is interactive, but it's

**Ernesto Josato:**
pre-programmed interaction.

**SPEAKER_00:**
after have that. Now my concern

**Ernesto Josato:**
And that is much more cost effective.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yes. Um for you because the if you're trying to get these live, you know,

**Ernesto Josato:**
translations, it gets

**Ernesto Josato:**
real quick.

**SPEAKER_00:**
now

**Ernesto Josato:**
But you can do it like I I've already done with the you can do it with voice, you can do it with pre-program.

**Ernesto Josato:**
um that's gonna be much more costly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I really just want them to ask the question so the student doesn't have to read the question and just to make it faster and more

**SPEAKER_00:**
interactive.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Now the live one

**SPEAKER_00:**
when you were saying to do it AI,

**SPEAKER_00:**
were you saying just the app or were you saying the live show?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Now on the live show,

**SPEAKER_00:**
tell me how you you see that being done. That would be the that would be basically the costly version then at that point. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And that wouldn't be so bad because

**SPEAKER_00:**
like we'd make

**SPEAKER_00:**
we'd have a certain budget for a show. So if it was gonna be two hundred dollars a week or five hundred dollars a week, we'll have a budget for

**SPEAKER_00:**
five hundred dollars. So that's not an issue.

**SPEAKER_00:**
that'll be fine.

**SPEAKER_00:**
If that costs

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know the good thing is these costs are coming down.

**Ernesto Josato:**
so it would be basically like I say, so for the live show you're on

**Ernesto Josato:**
YouTube.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I'm saying for just

**SPEAKER_00:**
just the taping of it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Like when the students are live here,

**SPEAKER_00:**
how do you envision that?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Because okay,

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm thinking like it's it's

**SPEAKER_00:**
tell me if I'm with you,

**SPEAKER_00:**
they're on the screen,

**SPEAKER_00:**
whether it's one or two, the the

**SPEAKER_00:**
and we're we have a set,

**SPEAKER_00:**
and the students are on set,

**SPEAKER_00:**
and they're

**SPEAKER_00:**
how's their interaction with

**SPEAKER_00:**
the

**SPEAKER_00:**
the AI homes?

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean as long as there's a microphone either in a phone or something or a computer or whatever.

**Ernesto Josato:**
And we can get

**Ernesto Josato:**
that voice out to

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know a computer somewhere,

**Ernesto Josato:**
it's totally doable.

**Ernesto Josato:**
And then it'll it if the AI voice will will respond.

**Ernesto Josato:**
And then you have uh a talking avatar,

**Ernesto Josato:**
like in

**Ernesto Josato:**
um probably do something

**Ernesto Josato:**
different than Hajin, but

**Ernesto Josato:**
but you can have these um

**Ernesto Josato:**
avatars.

**Ernesto Josato:**
that are your talking heads and it'll take what it gets from the

**Ernesto Josato:**
the um

**Ernesto Josato:**
it'll take what it gets from from the the uh the AI and speak it right so it's gonna feel it can feel real the kids talk

**Ernesto Josato:**
process

**Ernesto Josato:**
and

**Ernesto Josato:**
the AI voice talks so

**Ernesto Josato:**
as long as you if you're live somewhere as long as you have

**Ernesto Josato:**
uh the ability to

**Ernesto Josato:**
get that microphone you know that audio

**Ernesto Josato:**
from wherever you're at to the computer, it it'll it'll work.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That isn't a problem.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, that's not a problem.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, my vision is

**SPEAKER_00:**
screen setup,

**SPEAKER_00:**
podiums around the screen, you know,

**SPEAKER_00:**
out away from the screen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
that's for one part.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The other part is not hard.

**SPEAKER_02:**
a lot of things.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So we'd have about two screens.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So there's like

**Ernesto Josato:**
for instance these avatars.

**SPEAKER_02:**
we could use

**SPEAKER_02:**
I I know this guy's like super corporate, but

**SPEAKER_02:**
but the point is it's like you know

**SPEAKER_02:**
somebody at a podium or whatever.

**SPEAKER_02:**
The internet here real slightly.

**SPEAKER_00:**
the vision because this is the era of this this era of kids have all gone through

**SPEAKER_00:**
online learning

**SPEAKER_00:**
because of COVID.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right. So

**SPEAKER_07:**
Welcome to the new era of video.

**SPEAKER_00:**
don't recreate that.

**SPEAKER_07:**
Simply type your script to get started.

**SPEAKER_07:**
Welcome to the new era of video creation with HeyGen. Simply type your script to get started.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So these are

**Ernesto Josato:**
the kinds of avatars that

**Ernesto Josato:**
they can accept,

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, the text that is sent to them from the AI and emulate it on the screen,

**Ernesto Josato:**
add their own

**Ernesto Josato:**
hands and body movements a little bit faces. So

**Ernesto Josato:**
that

**Ernesto Josato:**
so everything that you're saying is

**Ernesto Josato:**
It's technically possible.

**Ernesto Josato:**
This is my

**SPEAKER_00:**
This is kind of what um

**SPEAKER_00:**
I envision

**SPEAKER_00:**
kind of what I envision of

**SPEAKER_00:**
the stage. Now

**SPEAKER_00:**
they'd of course be

**SPEAKER_00:**
set set up differently.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I could even do two teams

**SPEAKER_00:**
of three students. I really want to do four teams.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Mm-hmm.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um but we'll scale it to how I can scale it when we get to that point. But that's kind of my setup

**SPEAKER_00:**
that I envision. Um a little more

**SPEAKER_00:**
classroom like um

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'm still working on how to do the um

**SPEAKER_00:**
escape rooms

**SPEAKER_00:**
where I should just do separate rooms

**SPEAKER_00:**
or

**SPEAKER_00:**
I was thinking holograms, I was thinking you know, I've got a few different ideas.

**Ernesto Josato:**
talking about physical escape room?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I want them actually it's it's basically gonna be three games.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Four games in one. We'll have the one where they're doing the rapid where the uh the host is ans uh answering asking random questions and they're trying to get just like going on.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And the second one would be the escape room where they're physically in rooms, like an escape room, trying to figure out math clues and get to the next room, and finally get to the um

**SPEAKER_00:**
the PE room

**SPEAKER_00:**
um and do a skill challenge.

**SPEAKER_00:**
If they make it through.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The last the the third one would be

**SPEAKER_00:**
the big board, different categories. You go down the categories, there are traps in there, you pick this category, lose points, whatever. We have that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And then the last one is the collaboration from every student at the school where they have answered the questions on the app. That's a separate part of the

**SPEAKER_00:**
what the app does. Answer collaborate uh calculate all the questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And then we my vision is we're showing some scenes of background. We did some background work at of the schools, some of the stories that are going on at the schools, so people and investors will know where their money's going pouring into the school, you know, like like

**SPEAKER_00:**
like American Idol does they'll show the backdrop to give you to get you more the the audience more involved

**SPEAKER_00:**
while the scores are

**SPEAKER_00:**
calculated

**SPEAKER_00:**
from the students um that

**SPEAKER_00:**
already answered the questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The three thousand students that I

**Ernesto Josato:**
But still along the lines of

**Ernesto Josato:**
like uh

**Ernesto Josato:**
a production.

**Ernesto Josato:**
answer me this. Is it

**Ernesto Josato:**
one studio that you're doing it or some sort of portable studio that you go from school to school?

**SPEAKER_00:**
One studio.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Okay. That would be better.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, it's one studio.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Where do you think it's

**SPEAKER_00:**
Uh

**SPEAKER_00:**
I want universal. No, I want to build out my own studio. That's what I want.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's down the road.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I want universal for that to be so much easier because they do all the work.

**SPEAKER_00:**
that's my second

**SPEAKER_00:**
And then there is uh in Orlando there is uh already studio called Afro Afro

**SPEAKER_00:**
Studio, something like that, Afro Television Studio, something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And they'll rent out

**SPEAKER_00:**
their studio.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That'll be a little harder because I can't do everything I want to do, but just for maybe a pilot or something like that, I could I can rent out their studio for for that. It's uh it's actually TV studio.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Do you run all this through

**Ernesto Josato:**
Sally? 'Cause she might have some sort of

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, she w used to work with VET. I don't know if she still has some sort of

**Ernesto Josato:**
connections with people who do television production.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'll get into that when when it's time. Well I don't but but you just made me think maybe it's time to get more people involved.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um, I want to get a pilot done.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's my

**SPEAKER_00:**
uh biggest thing. Now the pilot may I may not be able to do everything, but I've already talked to some

**SPEAKER_00:**
uh skate room people that that host the skate room,

**SPEAKER_00:**
and a couple of them are willing to change some things around because this is pre recorded, it doesn't have to be

**SPEAKER_00:**
exactly, you know, so say their skate room is already set up.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But in the pro post production, we said

**SPEAKER_00:**
it's scripted. So we just have the voices and the

**SPEAKER_00:**
and the images to show what we're doing, and we can make that up in production.

**SPEAKER_00:**
so we can do all of it at a pretty low cost.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um it's just the AI.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And that may be easy.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well, that'll be easier

**SPEAKER_00:**
um with

**SPEAKER_00:**
the fact that we're um

**SPEAKER_00:**
It's a pilot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So it's it's scripted.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So now we're just scripting the AI. We already know what AI is gonna say. It doesn't have to technically

**SPEAKER_00:**
have the functionality of in um of knowing because it'll just have a script. It'll just be saying the script.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So that part will be easy.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And maybe do a couple shows

**SPEAKER_00:**
that are maybe two or three shows that are scripted and um

**SPEAKER_00:**
So that we can just put it out there and have a product so that we can start start shopping it.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah. So the the technical part of that,

**Ernesto Josato:**
like I said, I mean that

**Ernesto Josato:**
that's totally attainable, totally viewable. You know, the production, the screens, uh it that's somebody else.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, yeah,

**Ernesto Josato:**
I got you on the technical, but you've got this.

**Ernesto Josato:**
But no, you're not saying anything that's overly

**Ernesto Josato:**
important.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Let's talk more about

**Ernesto Josato:**
how I can help you more immediately

**Ernesto Josato:**
with the app.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So, um, because that's really my real value.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes, yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
what was that platform?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um no no the that you made the app

**Ernesto Josato:**
famous AI.

**Ernesto Josato:**
you wanna go into my

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, let me see the back end just for curiosity.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I haven't

**SPEAKER_00:**
Because it's free to a certain extent.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And then once you start

**SPEAKER_00:**
messing with it, they'll start.

**SPEAKER_00:**
When you go live, it was like two hundred dollars a a month

**SPEAKER_00:**
and I wasn't ready to go live yet.

**Ernesto Josato:**
when you go live like having people use it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Just n nobody's using I mean

**SPEAKER_00:**
it'll be

**SPEAKER_00:**
you'll be enabled for somebody to use it,

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh god.

**SPEAKER_00:**
but like even if they don't use it still

**SPEAKER_00:**
with with nobody touching it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Go to

**SPEAKER_02:**
Contact.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, sign the MSOR. Okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh you want to sign it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know my password, so

**SPEAKER_00:**
here's where it's showing me

**SPEAKER_00:**
coding and everything.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um here you can edit it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't understand.

**SPEAKER_02:**
That's for you.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm less than it up so I don't get it on your walls.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm just reading your prompts real quick to understand.

**SPEAKER_02:**
You did.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Also in a Bible version

**SPEAKER_00:**
where we have the churches competing

**SPEAKER_00:**
to get people more, you know,

**SPEAKER_00:**
more centered to learn scripture.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So what it for for what has it done so far? What did you have? How much have you paid for the

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, this is like the free version because it's not published.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But how are you able to share the monkey with me?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Thanks just to allow you to share it.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh, with pre like preview or something like that?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I wanted this I want once I've

**SPEAKER_00:**
caught on

**SPEAKER_00:**
caught on to it, I don't know if it'll help you, but I thought like if they could get you halfway there, like you could be putting out apps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
in hours.

**SPEAKER_00:**
They can get you halfway and then you come in and you

**SPEAKER_00:**
fix all the you know stuff on your end. I don't know if you could 'cause you can copy and paste it

**SPEAKER_00:**
the coding and everything.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um so I don't know if you can

**SPEAKER_00:**
copy it to a server that you use and then

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, I want to see actually if I can send this over to GitHub.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh, you can download it.

**Ernesto Josato:**
oh, alright. Since this is a free version, you probably can't

**Ernesto Josato:**
send it over to uh

**SPEAKER_02:**
I don't know what the database

**SPEAKER_02:**
really's

**SPEAKER_02:**
only five tables in here, so it's not

**SPEAKER_02:**
like we talked about the end tomorrow.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Let's see if it's

**SPEAKER_00:**
I again I don't know all of this how it works. Um

**SPEAKER_00:**
If I'm not disturbing you by asking me this way looking.

**SPEAKER_00:**
how could I

**SPEAKER_00:**
how would you

**SPEAKER_00:**
put more information in there? Because like right now it's so limited, it it may have thirty questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So when you play it again, you're gonna be asked the same questions over and over.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I know that's maybe um

**SPEAKER_00:**
just having more space or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Would we be able to continuously refresh the

**SPEAKER_00:**
uh information

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, I could build I would have to build a uh

**Ernesto Josato:**
A backend,

**Ernesto Josato:**
like uh an admin panel where you can go in

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know upload questions or whatever, new questions that got something like that.

**Ernesto Josato:**
or uh

**Ernesto Josato:**
yeah, I mean with a real with a regular database, we'd

**Ernesto Josato:**
we'll have more flexibility because like with

**Ernesto Josato:**
this, I

**Ernesto Josato:**
don't know if they're gonna build it where you can

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean you could, but the

**Ernesto Josato:**
see the problem with these these types of things is like they they want to keep you

**SPEAKER_00:**
using there?

**Ernesto Josato:**
keep you using their things, you

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I figured that.

**Ernesto Josato:**
know. So

**Ernesto Josato:**
yeah, but I mean this issue started, right? And the good thing is is that I can

**Ernesto Josato:**
I could copy the code.

**Ernesto Josato:**
where's um

**Ernesto Josato:**
we were not going to flash off.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um I can copy the code

**Ernesto Josato:**
And have a dedicated key here too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
We can take a look at those and

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, they just

**Ernesto Josato:**
they keep it kinda

**Ernesto Josato:**
behind the gate, right? But they also give you enough

**SPEAKER_00:**
To to work with.

**Ernesto Josato:**
to work with if you're like going to, you know, somebody else who has all the instruction.

**Ernesto Josato:**
that's like

**Ernesto Josato:**
thing that professionals

**Ernesto Josato:**
we use to export, right?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Like

**Ernesto Josato:**
I can share my project with you.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So it's like, oh Roger, I need you to uh work on this and stuff on this particular thing. It's like, all right, here's my GitHub repository.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Download that and

**Ernesto Josato:**
and you can be like, oh it's just the CSS file.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I'm just

**Ernesto Josato:**
saying right now. I got you.

**Ernesto Josato:**
But um

**Ernesto Josato:**
but yeah they keep you behind a

**Ernesto Josato:**
A wall here.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So they let you do all this free?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Well they give you like free tokens to get started. Right. Then you get to a certain point.

**SPEAKER_02:**
that's exactly how this works.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Alright, I'll be right back.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh yeah, if you log in on my computer, then I don't want to use it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Hit the Red X.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'll remove this.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Um just type just putting the box here.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Should go uh

**SPEAKER_02:**
just start typing in the people

**SPEAKER_02:**
that be always

**SPEAKER_02:**
every once in a while.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm gonna save that real quick so I can get back into it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
That's all right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I can get the app rolling.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know what it'll

**SPEAKER_00:**
at least get people

**SPEAKER_00:**
interested to see what we're doing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
What I really

**Ernesto Josato:**
Or you need a

**Ernesto Josato:**
this that's called an MVP. And in the document I made you it it's it's in there, but

**Ernesto Josato:**
you just need the the MVP.

**Ernesto Josato:**
That's what you need to be able to give and share with people

**Ernesto Josato:**
so they can actually

**Ernesto Josato:**
play with it, see how it works. Right. You know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I could do the basic

**SPEAKER_00:**
basically what what I have there

**SPEAKER_00:**
with the little functionalities that I want the speaking part

**SPEAKER_00:**
and I could

**SPEAKER_00:**
but if I could

**SPEAKER_00:**
allow the kids to log on or

**SPEAKER_00:**
download not download app but create an account,

**SPEAKER_00:**
I could use that to okay, see I got it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
30,000 kids.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, they have created accounts. Our app has this many. So now when I go to sponsors,

**SPEAKER_00:**
you have the access. Now you have I've

**SPEAKER_00:**
I've given you the access to thirty thousand kids.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's what I'm trying to get to. So I can actually have a product. I watch Shark Tank a lot and they want you to have subscribers.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I can get a bunch of subscribers.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I know and I'll do the leg work, I'll start I can do I can start going to the schools. I reached out to schools. I don't know why it's so hard to get people to call you back on stuff.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Very high.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know. But I know if I went there, I I know I can grab certain schools. I went well actually I attacked networks. I didn't attack schools.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I tried to get in touch with the those big hub networks

**SPEAKER_00:**
with with already the hundred schools.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I attacked them first.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But again, it it I know for some of them with a lot with all the fraud and scams going around, it doesn't, you know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I know I can't get this stupid thing on the screen.

**SPEAKER_02:**
That's what we

**SPEAKER_02:**
just

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, it just made a

**SPEAKER_02:**
mock user.

**SPEAKER_02:**
That that's what you use with the demo.

**SPEAKER_02:**
They give you a email and password

**SPEAKER_02:**
and that's

**SPEAKER_02:**
But yeah, see, like you can even get into the tables to see your data.

**SPEAKER_02:**
You can insert stuff,

**SPEAKER_02:**
you don't let it go too much.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh I don't know if you're paying maybe that'd be

**SPEAKER_02:**
say give you more things, but

**SPEAKER_02:**
Goodness crazy.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Damn, that's uh

**SPEAKER_00:**
I didn't know that was good or bad.

**SPEAKER_02:**
that's real exclusive.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But if I'm

**SPEAKER_00:**
if I got the numbers that I want is not that bad.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But you gotta get there, thank you.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So basically $247 a month.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, but

**SPEAKER_02:**
I mean I can host it on my platform for a much cheaper. Hold on.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh my goodness.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh maybe I should start upcharging people. Good, that's great.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Giving me ideas.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay, so they are using superbase in the back.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But you have to pay for that too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, 'cause I'll I'll end up putting on a super base too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
my plan

**SPEAKER_02:**
is much cheaper than that.

**SPEAKER_02:**
What's up, Bill?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh I'm in a meeting with that stuff.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Absolutely.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Alright, but I got the command.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Joe

**SPEAKER_02:**
are showing me powerful.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm looking at this guy.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, that dude perhaps he he kinda runs around this name. I see him all the time and I'm looking at

**SPEAKER_02:**
function.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So you got a good picture of what I'm what I want out of that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
A better picture of what I want out of that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I know it'd be a lot more. Do you have um

**SPEAKER_02:**
Where'd you source these questions from?

**SPEAKER_02:**
You just hold a s at question. Yeah. Uh I was looking through your prompt. That's all you said. Okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But you need like more, obviously.

**SPEAKER_00:**
but there's like how many SAP questions are there? There's a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And then

**SPEAKER_00:**
you just change 'em around and

**SPEAKER_00:**
what I'm trying to do is I reached out to

**SPEAKER_00:**
I mean they're

**SPEAKER_00:**
they're publicly sourceable. I mean

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, Google just give you

**Ernesto Josato:**
No, but I mean Google just

**Ernesto Josato:**
Uh came out with a new SAT prep.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I I reached out to Khan Academy

**SPEAKER_00:**
for their database because they do S SAT prep.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't need them because AI will just make up a bunch of questions if we need it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Whether it's true or false, uh

**SPEAKER_00:**
I love AI.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It makes things just so much easier.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah, I do too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Um, yeah, this thing.

**SPEAKER_02:**
SAT practice retrieval

**SPEAKER_02:**
and Google has um

**SPEAKER_02:**
what was that called? Uh

**SPEAKER_02:**
Jasper yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Famous famous.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So the thing is with this is like it's

**Ernesto Josato:**
visually it's it's nice, but

**Ernesto Josato:**
functionally it's it's not over there. Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
because it won't be um fully functional yet, it's just a probably I mean we can do

**Ernesto Josato:**
Well you want enough to be able to show the randomizing feature of the questions that it's

**Ernesto Josato:**
represented.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So and that's what I have to put in is like a randomizer. So I mean, you know,

**Ernesto Josato:**
I'd like to have a hundred questions, something like that. Would that be good?

**SPEAKER_00:**
But remember um

**SPEAKER_00:**
it'll end up being a lot more because

**SPEAKER_00:**
you'll have the

**SPEAKER_00:**
I was thinking say 50 true or false

**SPEAKER_00:**
then the map portion for the

**SPEAKER_00:**
the skate room

**SPEAKER_00:**
the the leaderboard, uh Jeopardy leaderboard, uh not leaderboard but Jeopardy

**SPEAKER_00:**
squares or questions, so you'll have

**SPEAKER_00:**
question and then the final it was it's a bunch of questions

**SPEAKER_00:**
in the final portion. That now that's the part I I don't know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And that could probably be a separate app

**SPEAKER_00:**
or separate

**SPEAKER_00:**
the portion where the

**SPEAKER_00:**
okay my vision is to I changed it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
My vision is to send out

**SPEAKER_00:**
okay s okay say your school is in it Lakeland versus Caplin. We send out

**SPEAKER_00:**
a bunch of all everybody from

**SPEAKER_00:**
Lakeland and Kathleen have to have this version of the app, this maybe this section, this mode, whatever you want to call it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And they

**SPEAKER_00:**
at whatever time they get sent random questions, they have a certain amount of time. Say sort of 2,000 kids, we'll send five questions for each kid.

**SPEAKER_00:**
we use those questions for that last round of the show.

**SPEAKER_00:**
They don't know, nobody knows until that's the climax of the show.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So we have to get all of that information and then we're simulating that. You know, during the show we're simulating that, we're calculating all those answers like it's happening live and you know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But this is for the live show.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But we we used that we need to have the

**SPEAKER_00:**
the function on I don't need that round on the app,

**SPEAKER_00:**
we need to have the functionality on the app to get that information from the kids.

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's that's the better

**SPEAKER_00:**
That's the bonus

**SPEAKER_00:**
of that's the attractiveness of the app that every kid at every school has to have the app

**SPEAKER_00:**
So now my investors have access to all of those kids.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So there's gotta be a dashboard.

**Ernesto Josato:**
On the back that somebody can operate to start to to create a session,

**Ernesto Josato:**
a gaming session, and then have real

**Ernesto Josato:**
live access

**Ernesto Josato:**
to push questions to the gaming session uh session.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um so this we can start on the basics

**Ernesto Josato:**
of

**SPEAKER_00:**
And do that later.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, that would be a 'cause that goes along with the whole live TV thing. Yeah. Not live internet thing. So

**Ernesto Josato:**
um okay. What's your budget for this? That that's getting the real question.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean, do you you

**Ernesto Josato:**
do you have money to uh

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know to for me to start building this house? Like do you have a budget?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I don't know what it'll cost.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean I I can start building out what's called the MVP. I mean you've got

**Ernesto Josato:**
you've kinda got a shell with the visual thing, but I mean to add functionality,

**Ernesto Josato:**
that's really what I need to do more than anything.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean I think to get it functional to to where a

**Ernesto Josato:**
more or less

**Ernesto Josato:**
you you could have it functional enough to go in front of people.

**Ernesto Josato:**
That's not including this

**Ernesto Josato:**
this live interaction. Right, right. That's that's not that's a whole different theme. Right.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um this is just for seated questions.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Uh this it's when I say seated, like pre program.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Pre program questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Right now the app has to be good enough for when we have our pitch party.

**SPEAKER_00:**
to dazzle some oh this is cool you know and I need some rich people to say this is cool and it's difficult for their oh I don't even remember this from school and so that's all I need the app for right now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Then I'm gonna do the pilot

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, I need the so you need uh a working MVP

**Ernesto Josato:**
which is um it's like a proof of concept.

**Ernesto Josato:**
And so um

**SPEAKER_00:**
And it okay right it doesn't have to have the fourth round.

**SPEAKER_00:**
explain to me the round again. So first round is the rapid it's gonna be rapid question and if they're Q4 press the button.

**Ernesto Josato:**
okay and their SAP questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Random.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The second part is gonna be the map portion, map escape room. I don't that doesn't have to be on there. I can explain that and kind of talk that through. Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But you

**Ernesto Josato:**
You do have a math section on

**SPEAKER_00:**
it's it's on there, but it does it won't give the visual. I can give the visual in person

**SPEAKER_00:**
um for the for

**Ernesto Josato:**
oh for the escape room, but

**SPEAKER_00:**
I can simulate that enough. I can record and simulate that enough to to do it for them. I can do that separate. The app doesn't have to have it. Let's keep the app simple and listen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The third portion is the book, the board. Like the Jeopardy board,

**Ernesto Josato:**
freestyle board.

**SPEAKER_00:**
the Jeopardy style board.

**SPEAKER_00:**
In there and it has some questions. Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
so basically those two portions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. And then what was the portion?

**Ernesto Josato:**
That'll be a separate part. Okay, that'll be separate. Okay. So we have the

**Ernesto Josato:**
The three.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I'll make it functional for what you have. But you have three sections on here already. So we're just gonna keep rolling with that.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Add some functionality.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um we'll

**Ernesto Josato:**
add the ability to

**Ernesto Josato:**
uh we're gonna put some more questions in there.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I've got to put a randomizer in there to actually truly randomize the questions.

**SPEAKER_00:**
The portion, let me know if you we can do this now or add it later. Um I thought it was a cool feature

**SPEAKER_00:**
of creating the avatar for that person.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Separate separating

**Ernesto Josato:**
Each student has their own.

**SPEAKER_00:**
avaton? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
If it needs to be later, then it's later.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So like when you create your profile,

**SPEAKER_00:**
you recreate an avatar. Take a picture, we change you into it, because I don't want the kids showing themselves. So I want to create them into a low cartoon avatar.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Or maybe they can make their own avatar.

**SPEAKER_00:**
How would that go to here? Now

**SPEAKER_00:**
that's better.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Well, I mean it stays in their profile. They can create their own avatar, like, you know,

**Ernesto Josato:**
I got brown skin, I got a

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know, a big head, I got curly hair, I got you know

**Ernesto Josato:**
straight hair, white, whatever it's

**Ernesto Josato:**
um you might be able to do

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, even better.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I didn't know how that worked. I never created an avatar before.

**SPEAKER_00:**
People always send me stuff and I don't know even on Facebook, I don't know how to do this. That typically is how it works. Okay, okay, Create an avatar.

**Ernesto Josato:**
and that should be enough to get you started. Yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Alright.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um so w what would I what we'll be talking about?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um I think we'd be talking around

**Ernesto Josato:**
six hundred ish, somewhere around there,

**Ernesto Josato:**
to

**Ernesto Josato:**
to get it.

**Ernesto Josato:**
You know, it'll be hosted, it'll be live,

**Ernesto Josato:**
people can play with it.

**Ernesto Josato:**
He'll be able to have my little talking

**Ernesto Josato:**
pre program talking

**Ernesto Josato:**
person.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, yeah, I mean he'll he he'll

**Ernesto Josato:**
So when the um

**Ernesto Josato:**
we can it you know it can it'll say the questions in voice. Yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So I I'll do that. I now I might not

**Ernesto Josato:**
do animation for his

**Ernesto Josato:**
face. Yeah. But when the previous when the

**Ernesto Josato:**
questions present,

**Ernesto Josato:**
it'll say like I have it on my my citizenship act. Like is that a voice?

**Ernesto Josato:**
What are blah Yeah.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah. I can do that.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Perfect.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Okay, perfect.

**Ernesto Josato:**
When do you need this buy?

**Ernesto Josato:**
Okay. Alright. So as you can.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So we can start um we can start with

**SPEAKER_00:**
Working on that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um I can uh

**SPEAKER_00:**
Is this

**SPEAKER_00:**
okay, will this be something that they can start downloading?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Or not downloading but signing up for? They'll be able to actually sign up?

**SPEAKER_00:**
It'll be functional. I mean uh well because I'm gonna do a database

**SPEAKER_00:**
where users can log in, build their profiles.

**Ernesto Josato:**
the whole shit. Okay.

**Ernesto Josato:**
If you're gonna go for funding, like you need to show that they can log in, they can create their okay.

**Ernesto Josato:**
So we need to make it real enough. Yes. You know, not perfect, not every whiz bang thing that you ever wanted. I gotcha. But we need to make it at least

**Ernesto Josato:**
75% of your vision, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I didn't know we could.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Yeah, no, the tweaks we can do. Yeah, I I can do that on a at a fairly, you know, reasonable.

**Ernesto Josato:**
It it's it's not

**Ernesto Josato:**
it's not super hard.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay. Tell them what you need to get started.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um you need me to send it to you? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I will um you do Zell or you wanna go the same web channel that you did before?

**Ernesto Josato:**
that was better because they don't charge me.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Um but and I'll send you a contract this afternoon.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Just I gotta I've been recording our conversation so I I can

**Ernesto Josato:**
pick all the the good bits out of it and I'll make a a contract out of that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
So you wanna do the contract first and then send it or you

**Ernesto Josato:**
It's up to you.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean

**Ernesto Josato:**
you know where I'm at so it's not like I'm running away.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Okay, we we don't make we don't know if you say but we gonna make millions together. I don't know if you if you're tripping about that little thing.

**Ernesto Josato:**
send it to uh

**SPEAKER_00:**
your your phone number.

**Ernesto Josato:**
no send it to my

**Ernesto Josato:**
my other my Zell's connected to this phone. It's um for my business account. Uh 863 from

**SPEAKER_02:**
777-1824.

**SPEAKER_02:**
This should come up as Dressato Group LLC.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I d uh also will eventually send you a a hosting.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I'll send you a hosting thing too, and that's just gonna be like 40 a month

**Ernesto Josato:**
for the super base server and uh hosting that.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Just so you know.

**SPEAKER_00:**
W are can you send me a um

**SPEAKER_00:**
can you send me a

**SPEAKER_00:**
a request

**SPEAKER_00:**
on lail because I don't know how to add. Oh you know what? Hang on, I might be able to

**SPEAKER_00:**
Um give you a QR code to scan.

**SPEAKER_02:**
This is cool.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay, directly into that account. Okay.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Okay, there we go.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Is it a business account or your personal account?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Uh oh I got it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Alright, there you go.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Thanks, you said.

**SPEAKER_02:**
We good.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And I'll send you

**Ernesto Josato:**
You can ignore the message from Mrs. Ean.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Oh everything is taken care of.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Grace up here.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Sorry.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Like I said, I've got this AI assistant, so she checks in and

**Ernesto Josato:**
You know, it's like, okay, these are all the things that's happening. It'll go out to my email and say, okay,

**Ernesto Josato:**
it's like like I said, it's like a real person.

**Ernesto Josato:**
but also like a real person, I need to give them give her updates.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Right. So she stops telling me over and over again.

**Ernesto Josato:**
I mean, it's good in one way, you know, like, hey, don't let this go. It sounds like an urgent message.

**Ernesto Josato:**
Bet so I'll start working on that. Um

**Ernesto Josato:**
And are you up in Lakeland full time or are you still

**Ernesto Josato:**
doing a community?

**SPEAKER_00:**
